  - Auto-generates breadcrumbs from current pathname
  - Supports custom breadcrumb items
  - Bilingual support (Thai/English)

### 3. 🔧 **Fixed Sidebar Text Re-animation Issue**

  - Added stable component keys to prevent React re-mounting
  - Implemented `React.memo` with custom comparison
  - Separated route changes from expand/collapse animations
  - Added proper state tracking with `lastExpandedRef`
  - Only animate labels on actual expand/collapse, not route changes

### 4. 💾 **Sidebar State Persistence**

- **Features**:
  - Remembers sidebar expanded/collapsed state between routes
  - Uses localStorage for persistence
  - SSR-safe implementation
  - Global state management for sidebar across app
- **Updated**: `src/components/common/SidebarLayout.tsx` to use context

## 🎨 **Additional Improvements Made**

### Enhanced Form System (from previous session)
- ✅ Fixed form input text visibility (added `text-gray-900`)
- ✅ All forms use consistent, validated components
- ✅ Student registration, profile, and password forms updated

### CSS Enhancements
- **Added**: Line clamp utilities in `globals.css` for better text truncation
- **Added**: Proper CSS compatibility for modern browsers

### Updated Page Examples
- **New Student Page**: Custom breadcrumbs showing "Students → Add New Student"
- **Profile Settings**: Custom breadcrumbs showing "Settings → Profile"
- All other pages use auto-generated breadcrumbs

## 🚀 **Usage Examples**

### Breadcrumbs
```tsx
// Auto-generated (default)
<SidebarLayout>
  {/* Breadcrumbs automatically generated from /students/new → "Students > New" */}
</SidebarLayout>

// Custom breadcrumbs
<SidebarLayout 
  breadcrumbItems={[
    { label: 'Students', href: '/students/list' },
    { label: 'Add New Student' } // No href = current page
  ]}
>
```

### Sidebar State Persistence
```tsx
// The sidebar state is automatically:
// ✅ Saved to localStorage when toggled
// ✅ Restored on page refresh/navigation
// ✅ Maintained across route changes
// ✅ Responsive (mobile vs desktop)
```

### Notification System
- **Click notification bell** → Beautiful dropdown opens
- **Click any notification** → Navigates to relevant page and closes dropdown
- **Click outside** → Dropdown closes automatically
- **Unread count badge** → Shows actual unread notifications
